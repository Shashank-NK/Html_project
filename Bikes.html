        <p>Bikes, or bicycles, are a popular and eco-friendly mode of transportation used by people of all ages. They
            are powered by human effort, making them both healthy and cost-effective. Bikes help reduce traffic
            congestion and pollution while promoting physical fitness and mental well-being. Over the years, bicycles
            have evolved into many types, including road bikes, mountain bikes, and electric bikes, each designed for
            different terrains and purposes. Easy to maintain and fun to ride, bikes continue to be an important part of
            daily commuting, sports, and recreation around the world.
